    Reactive programming has taken JavaScript by storm over the last decade, and for good reason; front-end development greatly benefits from the simplicity of writing user interface code that "reacts" to data changes, eliminating substantial error-prone imperative code tasked with updating UIs. However, while the popularity has increased, tools and techniques have not always kept up with modern browser functionality, web APIs, language capabilities, and optimal algorithms for performance, scalability, syntactic ease, and long-term stability. In this post, let's look at some of the newer technologies, techniques, and capabilities that are now available, and demonstrate these in the context of a new library, Alkali.

    Although there are a lot of base array manipulation methods in modern JavaScript like reduce, there are not a lot methods to manipulate objects. One of the simplist operations is to transform the values of an object while keeping the keys to reference them. By using a mapValues function, the object maintainance can be reduced and everything can be returned:A mapKeys function is less useful, but it has an interesting implementation: The callback was just shifted into the key creation. Both mapKeys and mapValues are present in utility libraries like LoDash.

    Pub-sub messaging is a very common design pattern that is increasingly found in distributed systems powering Internet applications. These applications provide real-time services, and need publish-latencies of 5ms on average and no more than 15ms at the 99th percentile. At Internet scale, these applications require a messaging system with ordering, strong durability, and delivery guarantees. In order to handle the “five 9’s” durability requirements of a production environment, the messages have to be committed on multiple disks or nodes.

    The techniques we will look at include queued rendering, pull-based granular reactivity, reactive ES6 generators and expressions, reactive native web components, and reversible directional flow. These approaches are more than just fad-driven progamming, they are the result of adopted browser technologies and incremental research and development that produce better performance, cleaner code, inter-operability with future components, and improved encapsulation. Again, we will be looking at Alkali for examples of resulting simple succinct declarative style (you can jump ahead see the Alkali todo-mvc application for a more complete example) with standard native element architecture and perhaps the most important feature we can build: fast performance with minimal resource consumption. These modern techniques really do yield substantial performance, efficiency, and scalability benefits. And with the constant churn of new libraries, the most prescient and stable architecture is building directly on the standards-based browser element/component API.

    Over the past year or two, someone has been probing the defenses of the companies that run critical pieces of the Internet. These probes take the form of precisely calibrated attacks designed to determine exactly how well these companies can defend themselves, and what would be required to take them down. We don't know who is doing this, but it feels like a large nation state. China or Russia would be my first guesses. First, a little background. If you want to take a network off the Internet, the easiest way to do it is with a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS). Like the name says, this is an attack designed to prevent legitimate users from getting to the site. There are subtleties, but basically it means blasting so much data at the site that it's overwhelmed. These attacks are not new: hackers do this to sites they don't like, and criminals have done it as a method of extortion. There is an entire industry, with an arsenal of technologies, devoted to DDoS defense. But largely it's a matter of bandwidth. If the attacker has a bigger fire hose of data than the defender has, the attacker wins.

    What we've got here is two files with email address and bcrypt hashes then another two with email addresses and SHA1 hashes. It's a relatively even distribution of the two which appears to represent a transition from the weaker SHA variant to bcrypt's adaptive workload approach at some point in time. Only half the accounts get the "good" algorithm but here's the rub: the bcrypt accounts include the salt whilst the SHA1 accounts don't. It's just as well because it would be a far more trivial exercise to crack the older algorithm but without the salts, it's near impossible. At first glance the data looks legit and indeed the Motherboard article above quotes a Dropbox employee as confirming it. It's not clear whether they provided the data they obtained from Leakbase to Dropbox directly or not, although it would be reasonable to assume that Dropbox has a copy in their hands from somewhere. But I like to be sure about these things and as I've written before, independent verification of a breach is essential. Fortunately because it's Dropbox, there's no shortage of people with accounts who can help verify if the data is correct. People like me.

    Eremo Hermitage Cabin in Vallais, Switzerland
    Contributed by Brother Brahmachari Markus:
    This stable with barn in the Swiss Alps has been arranged as a refuge with solar energy. I live here all year round as hermit monk.
    The cabin measures 5x5 m (16x16 ft) and is situated on a height of 1,800 m.a.s.l (6,000 ft). Winter brings five months snow with no escape ;-) Two solar panels produce 500w during more than 300 days of sunshine per year! It is well insulated and has a wood-burning oven.
    To the next village and back it takes more than 6 hours. There are two forms of living: in social life or isolated. Living in a small alp cabin gives you a good opportunity to ask “What is the meaning of life?”    See more at eremo.ch

    What she says:I'm fine. What she means:Runas didn't fucking deserve this shit. Runas did nothing wrong, I felt more for Runas than any other lore character that has suffered ever, he was a beautiful elf and the struggle he was going through could've been dealt with differently. Instead of giving the 'death is the only way out' clause to an addict, it would've been better if he had worked through his problems or that we could've had a quest line or missions to save him from the suffering, to help him heal, to come to terms with everything and support him. If he really needed to die where the hell was his cinematic. I will never truly be over Runas the Shamed, because he was such a beautiful character and he deserved so much more than that awfully written end that he came to. What was Blizzard thinking? There goes not a day that I dont think about this and mourn that beautiful soul that could've been saved. Dicks out for Runas the Shamed.
